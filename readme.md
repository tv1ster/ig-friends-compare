## Motivation

Since IG not allowing to see who from your "friends" already unsubscribed from you, I created this tiny script while ago. But
I lost it, and decided to recreate it, since I use it sometimes, like once per year.

## Hor to use it

Open your IG account, scroll till all your subscriptions till the end and copy result HTML. Put this html in `from` field. So the same 
with your subscribers and `to` field.
